###For Files
```
git init                      # initialize a local repository

#---STATUS---
git status                    # tracked, untracked, modified, staged
git status -s                 # short form: M-modified, A-staged(added), ??-untracked

git add .
git add -A

#---COMMIT---
git commit -m "<commit text>" # one line commit comment
git commit                    # will open text editor for commenting

#---REMOVE--- from staging (files must be staged)
git rm -f <filename>          # delete file and/or remove tracked deleted files from staging
git rm --cached <filename>    # remove from staging area (does not delete underlying file)
                              # in case accidentally added

git mv <from_file> <to_file>

#---LOG---
git log
git log -p                    # difference between the last two commits

git log --one-line            # show each commit on one line
git log --stat
git log --pretty=oneline
git log --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s"
git log --since=2.weeks
git log -S<function_name>     # search logs for string <function name>
```
###For Repositories and Branches
```
git remote -v                 # show connections
git branch -a                 # show all branches

git remote add fff git@github.com:<username>/<githhub reponame>
git fetch fff
git pull 

#---CHECKOUT--- switch branches
git checkout master                   # switch branches
git checkout -b <my-branch-name>      # do checkout and create new branch
git checkout ####### file             # restore a file from commit tag ####### (seven digits)

#---RESET--- reset a branch
git reset --hard HEAD^          # resets branch to last commit and removes last commit from history
git reset --hard HEAD~2         # resets last 2 commits
git reset --hard fff/master

#---STASH--- push a branch onto a saved stack
git stash                       # creates a stash  
git stash save  
git stash save "description"  
git stash list                  # lists stashes  
git stash drop stash@{0}        # delete first stash
git stash drop stash@{1}        # delete second stash
git stash

```

###Initializing Repository from PC
```
# goto directory above where you want the project
git new <project name>
cd <project name>
                      # with a preexisting directory, start here
git init              # initialize
```
At this point, the \<project name\> repository needs to be created on GiutHub  
Set the upstream name
Then **fetch** from the GitHub to get the README.md file
```
git status                    # have a look
git add -A                    # add files
git commit -m "first commit"
git pull https://github.com/<username>/<project name>.git
git push --set-upstream https://github.com/<username>/<project name>.git master
```
###Change Origin Repository
from: http://blog.aplikacja.info/2010/08/switch-origin-of-your-git-repository/  

Where is the current **origin**  
```
  git remote -v
      origin	git@github.com:phran/forever-family-foundation.git (fetch)
      origin	git@github.com:phran/forever-family-foundation.git (push)

  git remote rm origin
  git remote -v
  git remote add origin git@github.com:peterpih/forever-family-foundation
  git remote -v
      origin	git@github.com:peterpih/forever-family-foundation (fetch)
      origin	git@github.com:peterpih/forever-family-foundation (push)

  git config master.remote origin
  git config master.merge refs/heads/master
  git status

  (then either)
  git push --set-upstream origin master
      -or-
  git push --set-upstream origin master -force
```

###GitHub Flow
Useful link: https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/  

GitHub staging:
- **Create a branch**
  - When you're working on a project, you're going to have a bunch of different features or ideas in progress at any given time â€“ some of which are ready to go, and others which are not. Branching exists to help you manage this workflow. When you create a branch in your project, you're creating an environment where you can try out new ideas. Changes you make on a branch don't affect the master branch, so you're free to experiment and commit changes, safe in the knowledge that your branch won't be merged until it's ready to be reviewed by someone you're collaborating with.
- **Add commits**
  - Once your branch has been created, it's time to start making changes. Whenever you add, edit, or delete a file, you're making a commit, and adding them to your branch. This process of adding commits keeps track of your progress as you work on a feature branch. Commits also create a transparent history of your work that others can follow to understand what you've done and why. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Furthermore, each commit is considered a separate unit of change. This lets you roll back changes if a bug is found, or if you decide to head in a different direction.
  - closing issues via commit messgaes: https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/
- **Open a pull request**
  - Pull Requests initiate discussion about your commits. Because they're tightly integrated with the underlying Git repository, anyone can see exactly what changes would be merged if they accept your request. You can open a Pull Request at any point during the development process: when you have little or no code but want to share some screenshots or general ideas, when you're stuck and need help or advice, or when you're ready for someone to review your work. By using GitHub's @mention system in your Pull Request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams, whether they're down the hall or ten time zones away.
- **Discuss and review your code**
  - Once a Pull Request has been opened, the person or team reviewing your changes may have questions or comments. Perhaps the coding style doesn't match project guidelines, the change is missing unit tests, or maybe everything looks great and props are in order. Pull Requests are designed to encourage and capture this type of conversation. You can also continue to push to your branch in light of discussion and feedback about your commits. If someone comments that you forgot to do something or if there is a bug in the code, you can fix it in your branch and push up the change. GitHub will show your new commits and any additional feedback you may receive in the unified Pull Request view.
- **Deploy**
  - Once your pull request has been reviewed and the branch passes your tests, you can deploy your changes to verify them in production. If your branch causes issues, you can roll it back by deploying the existing master into production.
- **Merge**
  - Now that your changes have been verified in production, it is time to merge your code into the master branch. Once merged, Pull Requests preserve a record of the historical changes to your code. Because they're searchable, they let anyone go back in time to understand why and how a decision was made.


##Git Bash Commands &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[link to Git commands](#github-section)
**Clone a local repository using Git on PC**
```{R}
# First create the repository in GitHub
$ cd <directory you want the repository to be in>
$ git clone https://github.com/peterpih/<repository name>
```
alternatively you can do this on PC (these steps will aso create a README.md file):
```{R}
# cd <directory>
echo "# 09_DevelopingDataProducts >> README.md"
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/peterpih/09_DevelopingDataProducts.git
git push -u origin master
```

**Change the name of a directory(branch)**
```{R}
rm --ignore-fail-on-non-empty .git
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/peterpih/09_DevelopingDataProducts.git
git push -u origin master
```

**delete the **.git** file in the PC directory**

### Push files back to repository
- **git status**
- **git add**
  + **git reset** will reset any **add**ed files before **commit**
- **git commit**
  + **git pull** for updates if necessary first
- **git push**
```{R}
$ git status (will tell you the status of the files: new, modified, deleted hilited in red
$ git add <file name>  or git add -A (for everything)
$ git status (will  hilite the added files in green which need to be committed)
$ git commit -m <message for commiting>
$ git status (message will say "use git push to commit your changes")
$ git push
```
If the **push is rejected**, it is because there have been other updates to the branch on GitHub  
You will need to **git pull** first so changes are merged, and the **git push**  
```{R}
$ git pull
$ git status
$ git push
```
```
git diff <filename>
git difftool <filename>

git add <filename>               # add a new file to the repository to be tracked
git rm <filename>                # delete a file

git log                          # shows history
git log --stat                   # show which files were changed
git log --p                      # shows the changes

.git/info/exclude                # ignore file for only local repository
```
At any one time, only one branch is currently active, this is the **checked out** branch, or **HEAD** branch  
Move from one branch to another using **checkout**

###gh-pages in GitHub  

**github.io url generator**: http://drastudio.github.io/url-generator/  

The project submission instructions suggest that you can make it easier for reviewers to see your finished html output by setting up a "gh-pages" branch in your Github repository.  That will automatically create a web site for the repo on github.io, with your html page properly displayed.  

Note this is entirely *optional* -- the reviewer can download or clone your repo, and open your html page locally in their browser.  So, if it's optional, why do it?  Several reasons:  First, it is easier for the reviewer just to click a link and see your html page.  Second, hosting web sites on github.io is increasingly popular, and it might be useful for other projects.  Third:  Free web site.  Let me repeat:  Free web site.  No hosting fees.  Fourth:  Your free web site is under revision control on github.com, so backup is not a problem.  

The setup for a gh-pages site for this project is actually simple.  If you look at the assorted videos and posts about it, or even Github's own instructions, they will be (much) more complex than you need.  That is because our case is very simple -- we just want everything in the repo to be made available on github.io.  The more complex case that most videos / posts are describing is when you want to have a special "about this project" web site, that doesn't just include the entire repo.  

The short version of this how-to is:  

1) In your project repository, create a gh-pages branch that is just the same as the master branch.  
2) Push the gh-pages branch to Github.  
3) Wait about 5 minutes.  Poof!  Your web site is available on github.io!  

So...follow on below for the "detailed" instructions, broken up into pieces:  

1) How to make your gh-pages branch...  
    a) using git commands in your local repo.  
    b) right on Github itself.  
2) How to maintain the gh-pages branch if you make changes to your project after creating the branch.  

Plus some "extras":  

3) A few other files you can provide to help people find things in your repo and github.io site.  
4) Some notes on git, Github, and revision control.  

***Another way using git**  
Push html pages to master branch  
```
git push origin master
```
Now create a gh-pages branch (GitHub-pages)
```
git branch gh-pages
git checkout gh-pages
git push origin gh-pages
```
This will create a gh-pages branch on github  
Also, create and push a .nojekyll file which avoids some of the fancy html in github
```
touch .nojekyll
git add .nojekyll
git commit -m "adding .nojekyll"
git push origin gh-pages
```
