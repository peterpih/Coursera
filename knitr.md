### Some Notes

06.02 Normal Distribution (Gaussian distribution)

	[ (2 pi sigma^2)^(-1.2) exp^(-(x-mu)^2) ] / 2 sigma^2

	E[X] = mu		expected value of X is mu
	Var(x) = sigma^2	variance is standard deviation squared

	when

	mu = 0 and sigma = 1	standard normal distribution

	standard	quantile	standard	percentile
	deviation	percent		normal

	1		68%		1.28		10%

			95%		1.645

	2		97.5% (95+2.5)	1.96				95% within, 97.5% below/above

	3		99%		2.33

	Example:
	average = 1020
	observation = 1160
	std = 50

	(1160-1020)/50 = 2.8		2.8 stdev
