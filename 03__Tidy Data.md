| Tidy data is formatted in a standard way that facilitates exploration and analysis and works seamlessly with other tidy  
| data tools. Specifically, tidy data satisfies three conditions:  
|   
| 1) Each variable forms a column  
|   
| 2) Each observation forms a row   
|   
| 3) Each type of observational unit forms a table  

**Messy Data**
1: Column headers are values, not variable names  
2: Variables are stored in both rows and columns  
3: A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables  
4: Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table  
5: Multiple variables are stored in one column
