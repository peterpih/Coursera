###Binomial Theorem
70% positive
30% negative
5 predictors

From the binomial distribution. First term 10 * (0.7)^3(0.3)^2  is the probability of getting 3 positives and 2 negatives (choose(5,3) in R), which is the number of ways to choose 3 from 5, times the probability of positive cubed, times probability of negative squared. 

Continue in that fashion for probability of 4 positives and 1 negative, then 5 positives and 0 negatives, summing them all together for the total probability of a majority vote.

Note that the second term has an error in it. It should be 5 * (0.7)^4(0.3)^1
