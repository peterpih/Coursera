This example is from: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1299871/how-to-join-merge-data-frames-inner-outer-left-right

It shows different ways to merge different dataframes

- Inner join - merge(df1, df2, by = "CustomerId"")
- Outer join - merge(x = df1, y = df2, by = "CustomerId", all = TRUE)
- Left outer - merge(x = df1, y = df2, by = "CustomerId", all.x = TRUE)
- Right outer - merge(x = df1, y = df2, by = "CustomerId", all.y = TRUE)
- Cross join - merge(x = df1, y = df2, by = NULL)

Here is the sample data:

```{R}
df1 = data.frame(CustomerId = c(1:6), Product = c(rep("Toaster", 3), rep("Radio", 3)))
df2 = data.frame(CustomerId = c(2, 4, 6), State = c(rep("Alabama", 2), rep("Ohio", 1)))
```

```{R}
df1
df2
```

### Inner join - intersection of both data frames

```{R}
merge(df1, df2, by = "CustomerId")
```

### Outer join - everything together

```{R}
merge(x = df1, y = df2, by = "CustomerId", all = TRUE)
```

### Left outer - only members on the left hand side (x)
```{R}
merge(x = df1, y = df2, by = "CustomerId", all.x = TRUE)
```

### Right outer - only members on the right hand side (y)
```{R}
merge(x = df1, y = df2, by = "CustomerId", all.y = TRUE)
```
### Cross join - all permutations
```{R}
merge(x = df1, y = df2, by = NULL)
```

### dplyr

http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html

```{R}
library(dyplr)
```

- filter(dataSet) (and slice())

- arrange(dataSet, <column1>, <column2>) - sort by columns

- select(dataset, <oldName> = <newName> ) (and rename())
  - starts_with()
  - ends_with()
  - matches()
  - contains()

- distinct()
- mutate() (and transmute())
- summarise()
- sample_n() and sample_frac()
